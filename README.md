# Exploring Arrow, SQlite

## Installation
In addition to the packages in the [Pipfile](./Pipfile), you need to locally install `sqlite` and `sqldiff`.

# Goals
- can we represent the Spine datastructure in Arrow?
  - e.g. expressing "relationships"
  - build against the [entity-only](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Database-API/tree/issue_215_drop_object_and_relationship) branch; see: @spine-tools/Spine-Database-API#215
- look at the cache implementation
