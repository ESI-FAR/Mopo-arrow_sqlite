# Exploring Arrow, SQlite

## Installation
In addition to the packages in the [Pipfile](./Pipfile), you need to locally install `sqlite` and `sqldiff`.

## Goals
- can we represent the Spine datastructure in Arrow?
  - e.g. expressing "relationships"
  - build against the [entity-only](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Database-API/tree/issue_215_drop_object_and_relationship) branch; see: @spine-tools/Spine-Database-API#215
- look at the cache implementation 

## ADBC Tasks
1. figure out how to set the PostgreSQL URI env variable correctly âœ…
   ```
   $ docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 --name postgres-adbc-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
   $ export ADBC_POSTGRESQL_TEST_URI="postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres"
   ```
3. figure out how setup & teardown for tests work
4. a. replicate table setup for FOREIGN KEY using their test framework (steal from PRIMARY KEY) linking to a PRIMARY KEY
3. b. replicate table setup for FOREIGN KEY using their test framework (steal from PRIMARY KEY) _not_ linking to a PRIMARY KEY
5. research about how to test FOREIGN KEY elements
6. create test cases

### Build hints

Setting `export CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` creates a
`compile_commands.json` in the `build` directory.  `clangd` can use
this to correctly recognise names and integrate with LSP.  When using
the `Ninja` generator, you have to explicitly call `ninja -t compdb >
compile_commands.json`, for `Makefile`s it is generated by just
calling `make`.
